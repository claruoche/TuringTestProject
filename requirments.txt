We used a Google colab environment with CUDA enabled PyTorch, huggingface transformers and data, 
in a python 3.1 environment. Our model architecture was a base transformer encoder, mean pooling/cls token,
and then a linear classifier layer for binary outputs.

To run the code, simply download the balanced_ai_human_prompts.csv and run the ProcessTrainEvaluate.ipynb in CoLab.
